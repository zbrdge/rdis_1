----------------------------

The intention of this project is to create a useful, freely available, and current reverse
engineering tool (with a BSD license). One major inspiration for this work came from
the paper "Static Disassembly of Obfuscated Binaries", which can be found at:

	http://www.usenix.org/events/sec04/tech/kruegel.html

Right now it is still in the earliest possible stage, it has only been built on Linux x64,
so far, with GCC version 4.4.1, and using the POSIX thread library to implement the first
stages of multi-threading. Some future plans include:

	1) Graphviz dot file output (hopefully with a single function)
	2) An extension of libdasm to support x64
	3) Heuristics for recognising all sorts of specific "code signatures" to help
	   in graph construction
	4) Automatic parsing of ELF, PE, and maybe other binary formats, for
	   determining entry points and other calculations which may be of
	   importance. Right now it just starts at zero.
	5) A program that Just Works (much testing, fuzzing, profiling, general improvement).
